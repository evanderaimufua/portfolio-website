I'm Evander Aimufua, a dynamic software developer and recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computing and a minor in Psychology. With a passion for both technology and human-centered design, I've led impactful initiatives as Vice President of the UX Collective, organized successful events like the university's first Design-A-Thon, and hosted the exhibit of a student web art gallery, where I assessed the UX/UI of the showcased work. I've also collaborated with various industry partners to showcase student talent. My expertise extends to game development, where I've managed and developed projects like ENID, utilizing Unity and C++ to deliver engaging gaming experiences.

In addition to game development, I've ventured into web development, creating a Spotify Album Finder, a straightforward web app designed to help you discover your favorite artists' albums effortlessly. Developed using React.js, Vite, and Bootstrap, it seamlessly integrates with the Spotify API, allowing you to search for artists, view their entire discographies, and seamlessly navigate to their albums on Spotify to enjoy your favorite music. Another project is my Money Tracker web app, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This app enables users to track their expenses and income, providing insightful analytics to help manage finances effectively.

This portfolio website itself I built it from using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Relevant coursework includes Software Engineering, Object-Oriented Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Management. Beyond coding, I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and psychology, constantly seeking inspiration from diverse disciplines to inform my work. Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid dancer, finding joy in expressing myself through movement, and I enjoy activities like hiking, immersing myself in nature's beauty, capturing moments through music, and exploring creativity through photography.
